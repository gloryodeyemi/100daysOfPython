    "To work out the love score between two people:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos.\"```\n",
