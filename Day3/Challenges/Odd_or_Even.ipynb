    "Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43\n",
    "\n",
    "43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5\n",
    "\n",
    "29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```6 Ã· 2 = 3``` with no remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "therefore: ```6 % 2 = 0```\n",
    "\n",
    "5 Ã· 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "therefore: ```5 % 2 = 1```\n",
    "\n",
    "14 Ã· 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "therefore: ```14 % 4 = 2```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops."
