    "### Instructions\n",
    "You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that **1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters** of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "number of cans = (wall height x wall width) Ã· coverage per can.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5\n",
    "\n",
    "                = 1.6\n",
    "\n",
    "But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the **result should be rounded up** to **2** cans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Input\n",

    "```\n",
    "test_h = 3\n",
    "test_w = 9```\n",

    "### Example Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```You'll need 6 cans of paint.```"
